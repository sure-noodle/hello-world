# hello-world
this is my first repository

I am a non-fiction writer, poet, teacher, and graduate student based in Queens. I joined GitHub at the beginning of a project for a course I'm taking on interactive technology and pedagogy. I just learned the most rudimentary features of html, and already I am attempting to build a program for student free-writes--that's New York ambition for ya! These are my goals for summer/fall 2015;

1. Design a really good syllabus, and
 1b. Write up engaging prompts for the four major assignments of the course.
2. Put up a blog for my trip to India
  2b. Include pictures that are edited to be web- and mobile-friendly, and
  2c. Include sound recordings of the rain in Himachal Pradesh.
3. Wrap up/get rolling on the Gregory Bateson publishing project.
4. Put something together that could be published.
  4b. Use the semester's access to great faculty to work on that publishable thing.
